*R&R* with *Comparative Political Studies*<br><br>**Abstract:** In democracies and nondemocracies, the share of content flagged as “fake” on so- cial media is on the rise, yet we know little about how fake news labels shape public opinion. This study examines the use of fake news labels in nondemocratic contexts and argues that authoritarian regimes employ them to reduce alignment with and trust in opposition messages. Using a pre-registered survey experiment conducted in Singapore, I find that government-sponsored fake news labels lower agreement with evidence-oriented posts from opposition channels, especially among government sup- porters. However, these labels do not significantly alter perceptions of the content’s trustworthiness or the reliability of its sources. Such effects vary depending on the attributes of targeted posts, as labels have limited influence when applied to politically sensitive messages that already attract low support or when individuals may hesitate to reveal true opinions. This research advances understanding of online repression’s consequences in authoritarian regimes.
