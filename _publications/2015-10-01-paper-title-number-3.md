**Abstract:** Restrictive Internet regulations, such as “fake news” laws, can exert a chilling effect on online dissent. While existing research highlights the repressive nature of these laws and their tendency to induce self-censorship among the general public, we know far less about their impact on online opposition. This study examines how nondemocratic regimes use the legalization of online control as a strategy of repression and investigates whether, and how, opposition figures adjust their online discourse in response to such laws. I argue that restrictive Internet laws function as signalling institutions that delineate the boundaries of permissible online speech. In contexts where the rule of law retains some institutional force, defying these laws may appear illegitimate to the public. Consequently, opposition actors seeking to avoid stigmatization as purveyors of “fake news” and the erosion of their credibility as information sources moderate their rhetoric, refrain from openly discussing politically sensitive topics, and temper their direct criticism of the government. I have analysed 8,751 social media posts from Singaporean dissidents before and after the law was introduced, and after posts they produced were flagged as fake news. I employ dictionary based text analysis and word embedding to track shifts in sentiment and topics. I show that government-sponsored labels drove opposition channels toward self-censorship, reducing the need for coercive repression. This study offers new insights into how autocracies adapt their strategies to maintain information control in the digital age.
