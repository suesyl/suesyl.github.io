**Abstract:** Restrictive Internet regulations, such as so-called “fake news” laws, can exert a chilling effect on online dissent. While existing research highlights the repressive nature of these laws and their tendency to induce self-censorship among the general public, we know far less about their impact on organised online opposition. This study examines how nondemocratic regimes use the legalisation of online control as a strategy of repression and investigates whether, and how, opposition figures adjust their online discourse in response to such laws. I argue that restrictive Internet laws function as signalling institutions that delineate the boundaries of permissible online speech. In contexts where the rule of law retains some institutional force, defying these laws may appear illegitimate to the public. Consequently, opposition actors seeking to avoid stigmatisation as purveyors of “fake news” and the erosion of their credibility as information sources moderate their rhetoric, refrain from openly discussing politically sensitive topics, and temper their direct criticism of the government. Using a dataset of 8,751 tweets posted between 2015 and 2022 by four opposition figures in Singapore, I apply a word-embedding approach to analyse shifts in sentiment and topic emphasis. The findings reveal a marked depoliticisation of content following the enforcement of fake news laws, suggesting that these legal instruments effectively reshape online opposition discourse and enable autocratic regimes to manage the digital sphere with reduced reliance on overt coercion. This study offers new insights into how autocracies adapt their strategies to maintain information control in the digital age.
