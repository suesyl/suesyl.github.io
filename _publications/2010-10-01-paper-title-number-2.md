**Abstract:** This study examines why some authoritarian regimes employ legal frameworks to authorize, legitimize, and reinforce broader strategies of online information control, while others do not. I argue that regimes’ approaches to online repression are shaped by the autonomy of political institutions, such as legislatures and parties, which influences their need to maintain a façade of legitimacy and procedural justice. In the digital sphere, where state actions are highly visible and traceable, repression perceived as illegitimate risks provoking public backlash. Institutionalized autocracies therefore turn to legal instruments to consolidate control, circumvent institutional checks, and preempt dissent, while minimizing reputational costs. When facing comparable threats from online mobilization, such regimes adopt internet-specific legislation that allows for targeted, routinized enforcement of punishable behaviors and strengthens the perceived legitimacy of repression. Drawing on a novel global dataset of online disinformation legislation, the findings offer mixed evidence for the arguments. The adoption of restrictive internet laws appears partly shaped by legislative institutions, whose autonomy tends to discourage, rather than enable, legal repression. Conversely, more open civic environments, characterized by lower levels of civil society repression, are associated with greater likelihoods of disinformation law adoption, suggesting that regimes formalize control when societal actors operate more freely and public scrutiny is higher. This study advances understanding of legal repression in contemporary autocracies and illuminates how authoritarian governments adapt mechanisms of information control to the digital age.
