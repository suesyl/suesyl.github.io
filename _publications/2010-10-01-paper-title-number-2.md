**Abstract:** This research examines why authoritarian regimes repress the online sphere by varying in their reliance on legal frameworks to authorize, legitimize, and supplement broader strategies of information control. I argue that authoritarian regimes’ approaches to online repression are shaped by the autonomy of institutions, such as legislatures and political parties, which affects the need to maintain a façade of procedural justice. In the digital space, where visibility and traceability are greater than offline, authoritarian regimes are acutely aware that repression perceived as illegitimate can provoke public backlash. Institutionalized autocracies, therefore, leverage legal mechanisms to exert control over the information environment to circumvent checks and balances, and preemptively suppress dissent, minimizing the risk of public backlash. When facing comparable threats from online mobilization, such regimes introduce Internet-specific legislation that enables precise, swift, and routine enforcement of punishable behaviors while bolstering institutional approval and the perceived legitimacy of these tactics. This study advances our understanding of legal repression in contemporary autocracies and sheds light on authoritarian information control in the digital age.
