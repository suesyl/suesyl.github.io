**Abstract:** This study examines why some authoritarian regimes employ legal frameworks to authorize, legitimize, and reinforce broader strategies of online information control, while others do not. I argue that regimes’ approaches to online repression are shaped by the autonomy of political institutions, such as legislatures and political parties, which constrains executive coercion and influences how regimes manage civil society demands for legitimacy and procedural justice. In the digital sphere, where state actions are highly visible and easily traceable, repression perceived as illegitimate risks provoking public backlash. Institutionalized autocracies therefore turn to legal instruments to consolidate control, circumvent institutional checks, and preempt dissent while minimizing reputational costs. When confronted with comparable threats from online mobilization, such regimes adopt Internet-specific legislation that enables targeted, routinized enforcement of punishable behaviors and strengthens the perceived legitimacy of repression. Drawing on a novel global dataset of online disinformation legislation, the findings provide mixed evidence for this adaptive logic. Legislative autonomy directly constrains legal repression, yet the civic openness it fosters is associated with a higher likelihood of adopting restrictive Internet laws. These dynamics reveal how institutional autonomy generates behavioral pressures that lead regimes to recalibrate coercion through legal means, advancing our understanding of legal repression and the evolving architecture of authoritarian control in the digital age.
